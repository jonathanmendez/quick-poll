Quick Poll

The idea: Enable easy and unobtrusive flash polls of anyone who has a client installed.

Basic design idea:
- a server application that communicates with clients to push polls and receive responses
- a lightweight website to display results of polls
- a windows tray icon client to notify of new polls and allow user to respond
- phone clients that notify of new polls and allow user to respond
-- windows phone, android, ios
